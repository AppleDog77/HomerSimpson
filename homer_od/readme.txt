==Homer Simpson==

"D'oh!"

I started watching The Simpsons in November 2024, and became obsessed with it. It's hilarious, satirical, and a comedy classic, and yet it's also quite heartwarming and sweet at times, without going too overboard. I'm mostly talking about the first 10 seasons, of course, but I have enjoyed some later episodes. My favorite characters are Lisa Simpson and Homer Simpson.

In this ghost, you meet Homer at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, where he talks about random stuff to pass the time at work. You can feed Homer donuts by double-clicking his mouth, and pet his head by moving your mouse or scrolling the mouse wheel over it. But don't double-click his top strands of hair or his eyes...

Homer has soundbites! They're off by default, but I highly recommend toggling 'em on by going to the Config Menu for the full experience. You can also change the volume of the soundbites there, and the talk rate as well.

Homer will give you ideas to combat boredom if you double-click (or scroll the mouse wheel) on him to use his menu. You can let him ask you questions; if he asks you a question about his drawing, you can answer with one word, like good, great, awesome, bad, terrible, or synonyms thereof, and he'll react accordingly; otherwise he may or may not understand what you said. For the other two questions, it doesn't matter what you put in, so be sure to put the funniest stuff you can think of! You can also hug him from the menu. You can tell him to sleep, although if you don't, he will sleep anyway after saying a certain random dialogue. You can wake him up by selecting anything from the menu (except the music player, and sleeping and config options, of course).

Homer has a music player! You can drag music files (mp3, wav, midi, etc., and you can install LAV-Filters [https://github.com/Nevcairiel/LAVFilters] to support more formats) onto him and boop (double-click) his nose to make him play the music. You can access the music player directly through the main menu to change its settings. Double-click on his shoulder to stop the music, and double-click on his ear to pause and resume the music. Soundbites work fine with music playing.

If you double-click the donut, you'll find minigames: Word Search, Word Jumble, and Hangman. Homer wakes up to play these minigames with you. There is also a continuous petting minigame, so you may be able to find out how long you can pet Homer.

Hope you enjoy!

Terms of Use:

This ghost is redistributable, but don't delete anything! You can fix minor errors (typos, etc.), but be sure to add a notice that you did so in this Readme. You don't have to give me credit, but if you want to, just put this somewhere in the readme, or the page where you have it for download: Created by Odie Dog at Ladybug Lane. You can copy this as a template to make your own ghost for some reason, though, instead of the amazing one at: http://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/walkthrough.html, by Zarla, or one of the templates by Zichqec, which I recommend you use instead. :P The shell graphics can be used for anything (no credit needed, but don't make freeshells out of it), especially non-ukagaka stuff like games (I'd love to see that)! :D

Updates:
Released on Mon, May 19, 2025.
Ver 1.1 - Overhauled his shirt's appearance. Added Sleep Mode, Music Player (by Zichqec), Soundbite Toggle and Volume Settings, Idle between Dialogues function, new dressups, more minigames, more wordgroups and words, more clickpoints (ear, nose, and shoulder for Music Player controls), more favorite sites, and more dialogue. Homer will now react to what you say about his drawing (whether it's good or bad or synonyms thereof). Changed filenames of menu dics for sakura and kero. (Fri, Jun 27, 2025)
Ver 1.2 - Added new ties, new dialogue, new wordgroup words, a check for certain words in OnFileDrop2, TOLOWER to Drawing Reaction inputs, more expressions to meta stuff, and custom music player tooltips. Fixed the OnMusicPlayer.NotifySongInfo stuff in Boot.dic to be called at the correct times like the simplicity + music player bundle's implementation of it, to prevent issues with OnClose dialogue not working. (Sun, Jun 29, 2025)
Ver 1.3 - Fixed missing space in boot dialogue (and a couple other typos), fixed a sleep surface image, made collisions more precise, improved description, jazzed up the right click menu, removed extra surface files that weren't being used, made the Minigames menu not switch to the kero when pressing back button in it, added a special surface to the kero for Minigames, and added more Drawing Responses, dialogue, wordgroups, and words to wordgroups (as well as changing the name of a wordgroup from food to foods). Bundled my Sky Balloon with installation, as while it was not meant for a particular ghost originally, it fits perfectly for Homer; it can still be used by other ghosts being made in the future though.
