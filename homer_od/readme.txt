==Homer Simpson==

"D'oh!"

I started watching The Simpsons in November 2024, and became obsessed with it. It's hilarious, satirical, and a comedy classic, and yet it's also quite heartwarming and sweet at times, without going too overboard. I'm mostly talking about the first 10 seasons, of course, but I have enjoyed some later episodes. My favorite characters are Lisa Simpson and Homer Simpson.

In this ghost, you meet Homer at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. You can feed Homer donuts by double-clicking his mouth, and pet his head by moving your mouse or scrolling the mouse wheel over it. But don't double-click his top strands of hair or his eyes...

Homer will also give you ideas to combat boredom if you double-click on him to use his menu, and ask you questions, and you can hug him from the menu. If you double-click the donut, you'll find minigames, but currently there's only one: Word Search. There is also a continuous petting minigame though, so you might find out how long you can pet Homer. I'm also planning to add a music player to him later.

Homer has soundbites, but you can always turn 'em off by going to Ghost Preferences and turning off the Play Sound option for him.

Hope you enjoy!

Terms of Use:

This ghost is redistributable, but don't delete anything! You can fix minor errors (typos, etc.), but be sure to add a notice that you did so in this Readme. You don't have to give me credit, but if you want to, just put this somewhere in the readme, or the page where you have it for download: Created by Odie Dog at Ladybug Lane. You can copy this as a template to make your own ghost for some reason, though, instead of the amazing one at: http://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/walkthrough.html, by Zarla, or one of the templates by Zichqec, which I recommend you use instead. :P
